Make sure your environment is properly setup to access `my-gcs-bucket`.

One way to do so is to set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` var in your environment, pointing to the JSON file containing your service account key:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/[FILE_NAME].json"
```

More info on Google Cloud authentication can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started).

```bash
chartmuseum --debug --port=8080 \
  --storage="google" \
  --storage-google-bucket="my-gcs-bucket" \
  --storage-google-prefix=""
```
