Show all CLI options with `chartmuseum --help`. Common configurations can be seen below.

All command-line options can be specified as environment variables, which are defined by the command-line option, capitalized, with all `-`'s replaced with `_`'s.

For example, the env var `STORAGE_AMAZON_BUCKET` can be used in place of `--storage-amazon-bucket`.
